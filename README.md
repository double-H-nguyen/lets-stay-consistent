# lets-stay-consistent
I always had a hard time exercising consistently. I want to create a simple web page that will let me input my efforts, keep track of my consistency (i.e. you worked out "x" days in a row) and display my progress. I want to have a progress bar that needs to be filled to achieve some sort of reward at the end (i.e. workout 14 days in a row and you can buy "x").
