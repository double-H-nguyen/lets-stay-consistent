# Code With Friends Weekly (CWF) Check-Ins
A weekly check-in challenge to keep myself accountable and look back at the progress I've made.
This is a log of what I posted to `#check-ins` channel on the CWF's Discord.

## Week 0 (5/1/20 - 5/3/20)
* Forked [CWF's repo](https://github.com/ScottKwang/CodeWithFriends-Spring2020)
* Created initial project files

## Week 1 (5/4/20 - 5/10/20)
* Update libraries
* Add Entity Framework (EF6)
* Add models based on initial design
* Use EF to create tables in localDb
* Add test data

## Week 2 (5/11/20 - 5/17/20)
* Learned about the disposing dbContext (TLDR: good practice, but not required)
* Create test action and view to test querying ability
